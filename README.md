*Genetic algorithm to find the best neural network architecture with Keras*

Neuvol is a genetic algorithm API for neural networks based on Keras. The main idea is to work with data only, without direct architecture construction (but it is still possible).

##### Grow your own neural network!

- Data in -> Neural Network Architecture out
- ~~Set your assumptions about architecture, it will be taken into account!~~ (not yet)
- A large number of allowed layers types

### Features:

- Supported data types: texts
- CNN, Dense, LSTM layers are available
- Dropout and reshape sub-layers (Flattern) are available too

### Getting started:

TODO

### TODO

- [x] Architectures distribution generation
- [ ] Images support
- [ ] Regression models
- [ ] Generative networks (??? almost impossible)
- [ ] More available layers
- [ ] More options (assumptions)
- [x] Logo
- [ ] Visualization
