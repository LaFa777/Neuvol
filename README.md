*Genetic algorithm to find the best neural network architecture with Keras*

##### Grow your own neural network!

- Data in -> Neural Network Architecture out
- ~~Set your assumptions about architecture, it will be taken into account!~~ (not yet)
- A large number of allowed layers types

### Features now:

- Supported data types: texts.
- CNN, Dense, LSTM layers are available
- Dropout and reshape sub-layers (Flattern) are available too

### TODO

- [ ] Data generator for big data
- [ ] Images support
- [ ] Timelines support
- [ ] Regression models
- [ ] Generative networks (??? almost impossible)
- [ ] More available layers
- [ ] More options (assumptions)
- [x] Logo
- [ ] Visualization
