*Genetic algorithm to find the best neural network architecture with Keras*

##### Grow your own neural network!

- Data in -> Neural Network Architecture out
- ~~Set your assumptions about architecture, it will be taken into account!~~ (not yet)
- A large number of allowed layers types

### Features now:

- Supported data types: texts.
- CNN, Dense, LSTM layers are available
- Dropout and reshape sub-layers (Flattern) are available too
- All possible parameters for supported layers

### TODO

1. Add more supported data types: images, timelines, etc
2. Add more available layers
3. Add assumption options
